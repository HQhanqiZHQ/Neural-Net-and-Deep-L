The co-occurrence matrix can be *symmetric* (i.e., $X_{ij} = X_{ji}$) if the order of the words do not matter, or *asymmetric* (i.e., $X_{ij} \\neq X_{ji}$) if we wish to distinguish the counts for when $i$-th word appears before $j$-th word. \n",

However, they have been shown to learn problematic associations, e.g. by embedding \"man\" more closely to \"doctor\" than \"woman\" (and vice versa for \"nurse\"). To detect such biases in word embeddings, [\"Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases\"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4230) introduced the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). The WEAT test measures whether two _target_ word sets (e.g., {programmer, engineer, scientist, ...} and {nurse, teacher, librarian, ...}) have the same relative association to two _attribute_ word sets (e.g., man, male, ... and woman, female ...).\n",
